About the Assignment+ =>

This is a small NODE JS assigment where i have to perform some specific task  . 

RESTful API that allows users to upload video files, reduce their size, and provide them with the option download compressed videos.This task aims to demonstrate your ability to build a complete application using Node.js, Express.js, and integrate it with Amazon Web Services (AWS) services such as Amazon S3 for storage and Amazon EC2 for hosting.
